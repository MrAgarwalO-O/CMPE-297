This repository contains 10 Python files that demonstrate various use cases of coding with the help of Claude-dev extensions, such as refactoring, commenting, code generation, and autocomplete. Each script showcases a different application of Python programming and covers tasks like web scraping, image processing, file encryption, GUI creation, and more.

- **File:** `use_case_1.py`
- **Objective:** Scrape data from a website and save it to a CSV file.
- **Key Libraries:** `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `csv`
- **Details:**
  - Fetches HTML content from a specified URL.
  - Uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the required data.
  - Saves the scraped data into a CSV file (`scraped_data.csv`).

## Use Case 2: Image Processing

- **File:** `use_case_2.py`
- **Objective:** Apply filters to an image and save the processed image.
- **Key Libraries:** `PIL` (Pillow)
- **Details:**
  - Opens an image file from the input path.
  - Applies a blur filter to the image.
  - Saves the processed image to the output path.

## Use Case 3: Database Operations

- **File:** `use_case_3.py`
- **Objective:** Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a SQLite database.
- **Key Libraries:** `sqlite3`
- **Details:**
  - Establishes a connection to a SQLite database.
  - Creates a table named `tasks` if it doesn't exist.
  - Inserts a sample task into the table and displays it.

## Use Case 4: API Consumption

- **File:** `use_case_4.py`
- **Objective:** Consume data from a RESTful API.
- **Key Libraries:** `requests`
- **Details:**
  - Sends a GET request to an API endpoint.
  - Fetches and prints the JSON response received from the API.

  - Encrypts the content of an input file and saves the encrypted file.
  - Decrypts the encrypted file and saves the output.

## Use Case 6: Multithreading

- **File:** `use_case_6.py`
- **Objective:** Demonstrate multithreading for a CPU-bound task to improve performance.
- **Key Libraries:** `threading`, `time`
- **Details:**
  - Defines a CPU-bound task that sums numbers.
  - Uses two threads to run the task in parallel.
  - Measures and prints the total execution time.

## Use Case 7: Sending Emails

- **File:** `use_case_7.py`
- **Objective:** Send an email with an attachment.
- **Key Libraries:** `smtplib`, `email`
