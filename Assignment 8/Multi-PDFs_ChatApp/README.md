# Multi-PDF Chatbot

### Showcase: End-to-End GenAI Application with LLM Ops

This project is a **Multi-PDF Chatbot** built using **LangChain**, **Google Gemini Pro**, and **FAISS** for a complete end-to-end Generative AI solution. It processes uploaded PDFs, stores embeddings, and allows conversational Q&A over the extracted content.
