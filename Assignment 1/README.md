# **Experiment with foundation models Assignment**

This repository contains deliverables for a multi-part assignment focused on exploring **cutting-edge AI tools** like **Gemini**, **Claude 3.5**, and **GPT-4o**. Each part demonstrates specific capabilities such as summarization, multimodal tasks, coding showcases, and startup pitch creation using state-of-the-art AI models.

The assignment emphasizes practical experimentation, hands-on demos, and artifact creation across a range of AI applications.

---

## **Assignment Overview**

The assignment is divided into six distinct parts, requiring exploration of AI capabilities, video/article creation, coding showcases, and startup pitch development:

1. **Gemini** for long-context summarization, article writing, and multimodal tasks.  
2. **Claude 3.5** for extension-based development and startup pitch creation.  
3. **GPT-4o** for its multimodal capabilities (videos, images, audio, and text).  

Each part includes artifacts such as **video demos, transcripts, Colab notebooks, articles, and source code** to demonstrate the outcomes.
