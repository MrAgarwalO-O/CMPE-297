# Short Story Assignment
## Assignment Breakdown
This individual assignment focuses on creating a comprehensive yet concise "short story" article based on recent survey papers related to generative AI, with an emphasis on Large Language Model (LLM) development, applications, and evaluation. Key topics include AI engineering, LLM-based agents, prompting, reasoning, memory, tool use, AI risk, and safety.

The primary goals are to:

- Summarize Taxonomy: Provide an overview of recent approaches and taxonomies in selected survey papers.
- Highlight Leaderboard Techniques: Explain important techniques that are highlighted in the surveys, focusing on those leading current benchmarks in areas such as LLM development, evaluation, on-device deployment, and agent frameworks.
- Medium Article & Presentation: Turn the survey content into a reader-friendly Medium article, focusing on architecture, ablation studies, and key metrics, rather than in-depth mathematical explanations. Complement the article with a visual slide deck.
